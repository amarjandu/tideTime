 Need to start by calling the getFilterStationID.sh to get the list of
 All avalible station from the NOAA.

Because its delivered from a curl command, the file is going to have a ton,
of garbage in it, so use getCleanStationID.sh to get only the stationID numbers, which is all we are concerned with anway..
